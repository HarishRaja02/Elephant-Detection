# 🐘 Real-Time Elephant Detection using YOLOv5 & Faster R-CNN

## 🚀 Overview
Designed a real-time *elephant detection system* to mitigate human-elephant conflicts and prevent property damage. The system utilizes advanced image processing techniques, including *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), YOLO, and Faster R-CNN*, for accurate detection and classification of elephants.

### 🔹 *Key Features*
✅ *Real-time detection using YOLOv5 & Faster R-CNN*  
✅ *Achieved 89% accuracy with YOLO and 92% with Faster R-CNN*  
✅ *Data augmentation & transfer learning (ResNet, EfficientNet)*  
✅ *Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy*  
✅ *Early warning system for human-wildlife coexistence*
